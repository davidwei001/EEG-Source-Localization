# EEG-Source-Localization
Research on the EEG Source Localization and the Inverse Problem
## This contains files and codes that I used during my summer research at UCLA, supervised by Prof. Wentai Liu. My work focuses on the algorithms of source localization of EEG signal, also involves 3D modeling of human brain.
